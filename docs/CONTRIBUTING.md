# Contributing

- Branches: `main` (stable), `dev` (integration), `feat/*` (feature work).
- No direct pushes to `main`; all changes via PRs to `dev`.
- One feature = one branch = one PR; PRs must link an issue (e.g., `Closes #12`).
- Commit style: short, imperative subject line (<= 72 chars).
- Keep PRs focused; avoid mega-commits.
